***Opinions, Beliefs, and the Illusion of Perfection***

We often assume that our opinions are reflections of reality. In truth, they’re shaped by the “lenses” we look through, our experiences, cultural influences, emotions, and personal biases.

***Opinions don’t change reality, they change our view of it***

Whether we hold an opinion about a person, a place, or an event, that opinion doesn’t alter the actual thing. It only alters how we experience it. The person, place, or event remains what it is; we simply see it through a filter.

***How opinions become beliefs***

When we repeat an opinion to ourselves, or it’s reinforced by others, it starts to feel more solid. Over time, it can transform into a belief, a deeper, more ingrained perspective that operates in the background. Many of these beliefs become so embedded that we no longer realise they started as personal interpretations.

Because beliefs are often built from many small moments over time, we can rarely trace them back to a single cause. They’re the result of countless opinions layered together, consciously and unconsciously.

***The same lens shapes how we see ourselves***

We don’t just use these lenses on the world; we also use them on ourselves. Our self-image is filtered through the same opinions and beliefs we’ve built up over time. This means our view of ourselves is just as subjective as our view of anything else.

***Why “perfection” is an illusion***

If all our opinions are shaped by personal lenses, then “perfection” is not an objective truth, it’s simply whatever aligns with our current beliefs. Different people, cultures, and times define perfection differently. What’s “perfect” today may seem flawed tomorrow, and what’s perfect to one person may be unacceptable to another.

Perfection is essentially an agreement, sometimes with ourselves, sometimes with a group, that a certain thing meets our preferred standard. It’s not a universal fact.

***The takeaway***

•	Our opinions are interpretations, not facts.

•	Beliefs are just opinions that have been repeated and reinforced over time.

•	Even our self-opinions are filtered through the same lens.

•	Perfection is a story we tell, not a state that objectively exists.

The more we recognise that we’re looking through a lens, the more freedom we have to question it, and, if we choose, to see beyond it.
